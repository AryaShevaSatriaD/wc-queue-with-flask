# wc-queue-with-flask
## Hello <br>
#### I just needed to organize wc-queue when we go to family trips and made a website with Flask library (for making sample websites using python ) <br>
you can test the website [here](https://shayan15sa.pythonanywhere.com/ "here")

## How to use
1. Clone the repository and go to directory

2. Download all required packages with this command (I recommend using a virtual env like pipenv) 
`pip install packages.txt` 

3. On terminal you should set "FLASK_APP". There are diffrent way to that on diffrent OSs
	- windows-powershell `$env:FLASK_APP="hello"`
	- windows-cmd `set FLASK_APP=hello`
	- linux `export FLASK_APP=hello`
	For Other ones you can search and find

4. Now you can run the webserver with entering `flask run` in terminal (if you want to accses that on your local network run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0`)

5. if you want to use the scanner just run this command (before that set `Url` in qr-reader.py) `python qr-reader.py`
